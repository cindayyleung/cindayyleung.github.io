    "bio1": "Ms. Cindy received her bachelor’s degree in Piano Performance at the Bob Cole Conservatory of Music at California State University, Long Beach. She started the piano at age 10 under the tutelage of Mrs. Lily Kwok and since then has been part of the Music Teachers Association of California (MTAC) program from a student to now a teacher. During her time at CSULB, she studied under the tutelage of Ms. Chizuko Asada and played in masterclasses with renowned concert pianist Robert Thies. Cindy began teaching privately in 2016 by going to student’s homes and her studio has grown immensely, reaching to 25 students. She has experience teaching students of all ages.  ",
    "bio2": "Ms. Cindy continued her education at California State University, Northridge where she pursed a secondary degree in Music Therapy, studying under Ron Borczon, MT-BC and Helen Dolas, MT-BC. During her time at CSUN, Ms. Cindy provided music therapy services to adults with developmental disabilities, children in a school setting, geriatrics population, as well as patients in an outpatient hospital setting. She completed her clinical internship at Metropolitan State Hospital, where she provided music therapy interventions to the forensic psychiatric population. Ms. Cindy is now a board-certified music therapist working at Metro’s sister hospital Patton State Hospital, where she uses music as a therapeutic tool to meet the needs of patients and ultimately improving their quality of life.",
    "bio3": "Ms. Cindy is also an experienced musician with a demonstrated history of working in the religious institutions industry. As the age of 6, she was part of the Chinatown Children’s Choir at the Chinese United Methodist Church and after graduating high school would return as an alumna to volunteer as the piano accompanist and choir assistant. She also composed flute arrangements and performed them during the choir’s annual concerts. Ms. Cindy started as a volunteer worship leader at the First United Methodist Church of San Gabriel, where she led the worship team while accompanying with either the piano, guitar, bass guitar, or drums. Ms. Cindy is now the pianist/organist at the Calvary Presbyterian Church, where she provides music throughout the service. ",
    "bio4": "Aside from her musical life, Ms. Cindy is a veteran, having served in the Army Reserves for 8 years. She endured hardship throughout basic training and was chosen to be promoted amongst her peers. Years later, she was promoted to Sergeant (E-5) and was tasked various leadership roles and one of her biggest responsibilities was being a squad leader. She learned that the welfare and the wellbeing of her soldiers was her priority. One of the things Ms. Cindy misses most about being in the Army is having the opportunity to travel to different places such as South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, and Hawaii.",
    "bio5": "All of Ms. Cindy’s experiences, whether being a musician, a music therapist, a soldier, a student, or even a teacher, has shaped her into the person she is now. Ms. Cindy strongly believes that finding one’s own passion is very important. She strives in not only teaching music to her students but also teaching them how to love music. Ms. Cindy understands that every student is unique in their own way and learns differently. She will tailor each lesson and create a positive learning environment for all her students!",
